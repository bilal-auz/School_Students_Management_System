# School_Students_Management_System | Dec 8, 2020
School Students Management System build using pure Java + Swing Library for GUI components. (without Swing GUI designer) 

In this project I implemented the OOP concepts.
I used Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inhertantice and Polymorphism concepts to build well organized system.
